# Mautic - Google Season of Docs 2024
[Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/) is applying for the [2024 Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline).

## About Season of Docs
Google Season of Docs provides grants to technical writers to work on documentation for open-source software projects. Grants range from $5,000 to $15,000, depending on the project's budget. Here is the [Google Season of Docs project timeline](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline). In 2024, Mautic will select two projects and, if accepted by Google, hire two technical writers to complete the project.

## About Mautic
[Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/) was the first free & Open Source Email Marketing Automation platform. It was created by DB Hurley and launched in 2014 as an Open Source project under the GPL v3 license. Mautic is developed by a community of developers and marketers, which allows you to personalize the digital experience of visitors to your resources fully. The software has all the essential features, like lead management, campaign management, contacts and emails, and responsive email creation. Mautic also has features that you can only find in some emailing solutions, such as creating lead-generating landing pages and registration forms. The Mautic Community is a worldwide distributed team of volunteers passionate about Mautic, Marketing Automation, and Open Source technologies.

We come together to build, improve, and share Mautic, united by our belief in empowering organizations with the tools they need to deliver world-class automation and personalized experiences to their customers. This Open Source project is available in more than 65+ languages, and over 200,00 organizations already trust Mautic.

## Project Ideas
### 1. Improve Documentation to Include Mautic Version 5 Features
The current [Mautic documentation](https://docs.mautic.org/) requires significant improvements to comprehensively cover the features introduced in Mautic Version 5. Presently, it lacks information on the new features and changes introduced in [Mautic Version 5](https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Mautic+5%22), leaving users unaware of the latest capabilities and improvements.

To address this, we aim to address issues labeled [Mautic5](https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Mautic+5%22) in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/mautic/user-documentation) on GitHub.

The project deliverables include:
- Address Mautic 5 issues identified in the documentation repository
- Update screenshots and images to accurately represent Mautic Version 5's interface, enhancing user experience.
- Refine existing content for clarity and accuracy, ensuring it aligns with the current functionalities of Mautic.
- Add missing documentation where necessary to fully cover Mautic Version 5's capabilities.
- Enhance clarity and completeness throughout the documentation to facilitate user understanding and utilization of Mautic Version 5 features.

#### Preferred Skills
- Proficiency in Sphinx or willingness to learn.
- Willingness to learn how to use Mautic and set it up.
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub for managing contributions.

#### Success Metrics
- Track positive feedback from the Mautic community on documentation changes through:
   - Direct comments on GitHub pull requests or issues.
   - Mentions in the Mautic forums expressing appreciation for clearer documentation.
   - Increased positive reviews on relevant documentation pages.
- Monitor a decrease in documentation-related support forum posts asking questions that are clearly addressed in the revised guides. This indicates success in making the documentation more self-sufficient.

### 2. Improve the Mautic Installation Guide
The current installation guide may not adequately address common problems or the specific steps needed for different environments (e.g., Linux, Windows, Mac). Improving this guide will help reduce the entry barrier for new users and support the growth of the Mautic community. The goal of this project is to overhaul and enhance the Mautic Installation Guide to ensure it is comprehensive, up-to-date, and user-friendly for both new users and old users.

The project deliverables include:
- Add step-by-step instructions for installing Mautic in various environments, including Linux, Windows, and Mac.
- Include troubleshooting sections to address common issues encountered during installation.
- Add best practices for setting up Mautic across different environments, ensuring optimal performance and stability.
- Consider ways to structure the guide modularly to make future updates by the community easier.

#### Preferred Skills
- Proficiency in Sphinx or willingness to learn.
- Willingness to learn how to use Mautic and set it up.
- Experience setting up web applications on at least one of the target operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac)
- Basic understanding of server configurations would be an asset

#### Success Metrics
- Reduction in installation-related queries on forums and GitHub.
- Positive feedback from users on the ease of the installation process.

### 3.  Create content for the Mautic Knowledge base
The [Mautic knowledge base](https://kb.mautic.org/) serves as a valuable resource for users, enabling them to troubleshoot issues and utilize Mautic to its fullest potential. This project involves writing detailed articles covering a wide range of topics, from basic functionalities to advanced campaign strategies and integrations. The articles to be covered are listed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V-8N-vmkjzwIJ6qCRnAKYF6NFwG3i3DzLPeQS4jcgyY/edit#gid=0).

The project deliverables include:
- Produce 3-4 high-quality content for the Mautic Knowledge Base within a six-month timeframe. These articles will cover a variety of topics, ranging from how-to guides to tutorials to troubleshooting guides.

#### Preferred Skills
- Willingness to learn how to use Mautic and set it up.
- Experience writing blog content

#### Success Metrics
- Increased user engagement with the knowledge base, as evidenced by traffic metrics and reduced support requests.

## Submitting a technical writer statement of interest

## Additional information
### Previous experience with technical writers or documentation
Mautic's team of technical writers and volunteers is dedicated to creating documentation for new releases and Mautic version 5. They follow a structured process, including scoping, planning, and creating content in RST format.

To ensure accuracy and quality, the team uses the GitHub flow to review content through pull requests (PRs) before publishing it on the Mautic documentation site. This meticulous process helps in identifying, prioritizing, and creating content that will be valuable to technical writers collaborating with us in the Season of Docs program.

### Previous participation in Season of Docs, Google Summer of Code or others
Mautic has been actively involved in open-source development programs, including Google Season of Docs. In 2020, we welcomed two new technical writers, Swati and Favour Kelvin, whose work significantly improved our documentation. Favour Kelvin, an active mentor, previously participated in Google Summer of Code 2019 as a student and mentored in the Google Code-In program.

In 2022, we worked with Favour Chibueze to update our End User Documentation, ensuring that it reflected the latest information about our releases and migrating our documentation to a new platform. Favour Chibueze is currently a mentor and serves on the Mautic Council.

We're proud of the progress our technical writers have made and their commitment to improving Mautic's resources for our community.
